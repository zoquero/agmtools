Bunch of scripts, misc tools

The initial tools are perl scripts for managing CSV files:

* `csv_resize.pl`: Interpolate to change the number of rows of a CSV file that contains independent values
* `csv_merge.pl`: Merge multiple CSV files on one
* `csv_stats.pl`: Extract statistics from CSV files
* `csv_extract_header_names.pl`: Extract the names of the columns of a CSV from the first row. Prints one per line.
* `csv_extract_fields.pl`: Extract the selected fields of a CSV file
